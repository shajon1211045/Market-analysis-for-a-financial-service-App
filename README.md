GitHub Repository README - Easy-Money Financial App

Welcome to Easy-Money, your go-to financial app designed to revolutionize the Mobile Financial Service (MFS) landscape in Bangladesh. Here's a brief overview of our market analysis and the innovative features we aim to bring to the table:

Market Analysis:
Easy-Money is dedicated to addressing the gaps in existing MFS offerings while introducing high-demand services. Our primary focus is on Fintech lending, informed by the history of microcredit organizations in Bangladesh.

Key Insights:

Office staff and loan officer numbers fluctuated due to delinquency and the need for digitization.
Despite challenges, active borrowers increased.
Market leaders like bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and SureCash dominate the MFS sector.
A surge in agents reflects the growing customer demand.
MFS accounts in rural areas outpace urban areas.
Daily transactions skyrocketed from 10 billion taka to 42 billion taka in just four years.
A spike in registered clients in 2022 highlights challenges in account conversion.
Challenges in Account Conversion:
Several factors contribute to the difficulty of converting new customers into regular users, including high transaction fees and limited engaging features. Marketing campaigns often prioritize revenue-generating features like Cash-in, Cash-out, and P2P transactions.

Innovative Features:

Online Tax-Filing: We'll introduce online tax-filing to simplify the complex process, filling a gap in the market highlighted by the success of BDTax. Income tax contributes significantly to government revenue and has been steadily growing.

Trading on the Go: Bangladesh lacks a user-friendly trading app. We aim to provide a stable and feature-rich trading platform with unique features:

Social Trading: Users can follow top investors and automatically replicate their investments.
Islamic Trading: Catering to the Muslim-majority population with interest-free trading options.
Easy-Money is poised to reshape the financial landscape in Bangladesh, offering convenience, innovation, and financial empowerment to all. Stay tuned for updates and join us on this exciting journey!
