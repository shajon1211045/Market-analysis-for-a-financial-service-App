<h3>Challenges in Account Conversion:</h3>
Several factors contribute to the difficulty of converting new customers into regular users, including high transaction fees and limited engaging features. Marketing campaigns often prioritize revenue-generating features like Cash-in, Cash-out, and P2P transactions.

<h3>Innovative Features:</h3>

<h4>Online Tax-Filing:</h4> We'll introduce online tax filing to simplify the complex process, filling a gap in the market highlighted by the success of BDTax. Income tax contributes significantly to government revenue and has been steadily growing.
